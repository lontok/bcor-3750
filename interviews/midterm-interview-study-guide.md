### **Rubric**

What is the interviewer trying to assess?

1. How effectively can you identify, analyze, and solve problems?  
2. Do you have the business understanding and analytics expertise required for the role?  
3. How well do you communicate your ideas? Are you clear, confident, and succinct?   
4. **Can I trust you to confidently lead stakeholders through a meeting on a project like the one you’ve just described?**

| Grade | Criteria |
| :---: | ----- |
| A | Exceptional \- Clear mastery of problem‑solving, business insight, technical depth, and communication. Ready to lead without hand‑holding. "I’m impressed. Let’s hire this candidate." |
| B | Strong \- Meets all core requirements and shows growth potential. Only minor gaps to address. "Good enough but need to bring them in for another interview." |
| C | Adequate \- Satisfies basic criteria but displays uneven skills. Would require mentoring. "I have reservations, but they might be coachable." |
| D, F | Underperforming \- Fell significantly short of expectations, and substantial improvements are necessary to be considered for the role. "Hard pass." |

   **Example Response**:
   > "I'm a junior at LMU studying Business Analytics. I'm passionate about using data to solve operational challenges - I've been leading a supply chain optimization project for our student consulting group where we helped a local restaurant reduce food waste by 30%. Last summer, I interned at [Company] where I worked with inventory data and built Excel dashboards for the operations team. Outside of academics, I enjoy rock climbing, which has taught me a lot about problem-solving under pressure.
   >
   > That experience actually connects directly to the Operations Analyst project I'd like to walk you through today. I analyzed [your specific problem area] to help [your stakeholder] improve [your metric], and I'm excited to share what I discovered."

   ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │ I - INSIGHT: What did you discover?                         │
   │     → The data-driven finding or pattern you observed       │
   │                                                              │
   │ R - RECOMMENDATION: What should stakeholder do?             │
   │     → Specific, actionable advice based on the insight      │
   │                                                              │

   │     → Quantifiable result if recommendation is followed     │
   │                                                              │
   │ M - METHOD: How did you analyze the data?                   │
   │     → Steps, Excel functions/tools, reasoning               │
   └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
   ```



      **Analysis Coverage Table**:

      | Analysis Component | Slides | What to Cover | IRPM Required? |
      |-------------------|--------|---------------|----------------|
      | **Descriptive Statistics** | 6-7 | Central Tendency + Variability | Yes (both) |
      | **Diagnostic PivotTables** | 8-9 | PivotTable 1 & PivotTable 2 root cause analysis | Yes (both) |
      | **Strategic Dashboard** | 10-12 | ONE chart (Scorecard, Trend, OR Breakdown) | Yes (1 chart) |
      | **Operational Dashboard** | 13-15 | ONE chart (Scorecard, Trend, OR Root Cause) | Yes (1 chart) |

      **Total IRPM Cycles**: 5 minimum (2 descriptive stats + 2 pivot tables + 1 strategic chart + 1 operational chart)

      3. Connect to the job description along the way  
   5. Follow-Up Questions
      1. As you walk me through your project, I'll ask questions to dig into your thinking process. These aren't meant to trip you up. They're meant to see how you reason through challenges, adapt, and make decisions. I'm interested not just in what analysis you completed, but in whether you can clearly explain how you approached it and why you made the decisions you did. Expect me to keep asking "Why?" so you can explain your reasoning, adaptability, and understanding of your own analysis.
      2. Common follow-up topics
         1. Decisions made
         2. Challenges and how you overcame them
         3. Business implications
         4. Future improvements and next steps
         5. Lessons learned

### **Whiteboard Roadmap Template**

Use this visual roadmap structure on the whiteboard to guide your presentation:

```
[Job Title] → [Decision Area] → [Stakeholder] → [Problem Statement]
                                                         ↓
                                                [Solution Overview]
                                                         ↓
                                        [Dataset] → [Data Quality] → [Primary Metric]
                                                         ↓
                        ┌────────────────────────────────┴─────────────────────────────────┐
                        ↓                                                                   ↓
              [DESCRIPTIVE ANALYTICS]                                         [DIAGNOSTIC ANALYTICS]
                        ↓                                                                   ↓
        Statistics: Central Tendency + Variability                          PivotTable 1: Root Cause
                        ↓                                                                   ↓
        Strategic Dashboard (1 of 3 charts)                                 PivotTable 2: Root Cause
                                                                                            ↓
                                                                        Operational Dashboard (1 of 3 charts)
```

**Key Points**:
- Draw this from left to right and top to bottom as you speak
- Each box = one slide (or group of related slides)
- Use arrows to show logical flow
- Keep it simple - this is your navigation tool, not your content

---

### **Dashboard Selection Guidance**

**For Strategic Dashboard (Slides 10-12)** - Choose ONE to present:
1. **Scorecard Chart**: Best if you want to show executive-level KPI performance
   - Shows overall metric health at a glance
   - Good for demonstrating business impact awareness
2. **Trend Chart**: Best if you want to show patterns over time
   - Reveals seasonality, cycles, or trajectory
   - Good for demonstrating analytical thinking
3. **Breakdown Chart**: Best if you want to show segmentation insights
   - Compares performance across categories (products, regions, etc.)
   - Good for demonstrating detail-oriented analysis

**For Operational Dashboard (Slides 13-15)** - Choose ONE to present:
1. **Scorecard Chart**: Best for operational metric monitoring
   - Shows current operational performance
   - Good for demonstrating operations management mindset
2. **Trend Chart**: Best for operational patterns
   - Shows operational trends and anomalies
   - Good for demonstrating process improvement thinking
3. **Root Cause Chart**: Best for diagnostic depth
   - Connects to your PivotTable analysis
   - Good for demonstrating problem-solving skills

**Selection Strategy**:
- Choose charts where your IRPM story is strongest
- Pick different types for Strategic vs Operational (variety shows breadth)
- Be prepared to discuss ANY of your 3 charts if interviewer asks
- Practice all 3, but know which 1 you'll present first

### **Study Tips**

**Practice with a Classmate** (Most Effective):
- **Setup** (5 min): Exchange Milestone 1 slides, review each other's projects
- **Interview** (20 min): One person presents (15 min) + feedback (5 min)
- **Switch** (20 min): Other person presents (15 min) + feedback (5 min)
- **Debrief** (10 min): Discuss what worked, what needs improvement

**During Partner's Interview**:
- Use timing breakdown to give time checks ("3 minutes left for Descriptive")
- Ask "Why?" follow-up questions when they finish sections
- Note where they hesitated or seemed unsure
- Check if they used IRPM framework for all 5 components

**Giving Feedback** (Use the Rubric):
- ✅ **What worked well**: Specific strengths you observed
- ⚠️ **What needs work**: 2-3 specific improvement areas
- 💡 **One thing to practice**: Most critical item before interview
- 📊 **Rubric estimate**: Where would they fall (A/B/C/D)?

**Practice with AI** - [BCOR 3750 Midterm Interview Coach](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-68efca526c6c819186dc3a8a2cffa8b4-bcor-3750-midterm-interview-coach):
- **Use Voice Mode** (sound wave icon at bottom) for most realistic practice - speak your answers like the real interview
- Upload your Milestone 1 slides for personalized questions about YOUR specific project
- Choose difficulty: Practice (gentler), Realistic (standard), or Challenging (deeper drilling)
- Get ruthlessly honest yet supportive feedback on all 4 rubric dimensions
- IRPM framework validation - coach flags missing elements and guides you with Socratic questions
- Conversation starters to get started:
  - "I want to practice the full interview without my slides"
  - "I want to practice the full interview with my slides"
  - "Help me prepare my 'Tell me about yourself' response"
  - "Practice only Job through Primary Metric"
  - "Practice Descriptive Analytics only"
  - "Practice Diagnostic Analytics only"

**Practice with Yourself**:
- Record yourself presenting (video preferred, audio minimum)
- Time each section to hit the timing breakdown
- Draw the whiteboard roadmap from memory without notes
- Watch/listen back and identify areas where you hesitated
- Re-record until you can present smoothly within 15 minutes

**Whiteboard Practice**:
- Draw the roadmap template from memory on paper/whiteboard
- Time yourself - can you draw it in under 30 seconds?
- Practice pointing to sections as you talk
- Ensure you can draw while maintaining eye contact

**Review Strategy**:
- Identify 2-3 areas where you hesitated most
- Focus deep practice on those weak spots
- Drill IRPM responses for all 5 analysis components
- Prepare answers to question bank items you struggled with

### **Common Mistakes to Avoid**

**❌ Content Mistakes**:
- Skipping Dataset Overview or Data Quality sections
- Discussing all 3 dashboard charts instead of choosing ONE
- Forgetting to connect analysis back to job description
- Presenting data without IRPM framework (Insight → Recommendation → Prediction → Method)

**❌ Communication Mistakes**:
- Using technical jargon without explaining it
- Rambling without structure (use IRPM!)
- Not making eye contact or facing the whiteboard
- Forgetting the segue from "Tell me about yourself" to project

**❌ Timing Mistakes**:
- Spending 5 minutes on Foundation, leaving 2 minutes for all analysis
- Trying to discuss all 3 dashboard insights (choose ONE!)
- Not practicing with a timer beforehand
- Rushing through Primary Metric and data quality to "get to analysis"

**✅ Quick Fixes**:
- Practice the 15-minute structure with a timer
- Prepare to discuss any of your 3 dashboard charts (but present only 1)
- Memorize IRPM framework and use it consistently
- Use whiteboard roadmap as your navigation guide

### **Interview Tips**

* Take your time to respond.  
* If you are unsure about the answer, talk about what you do know first. It is better to say what you know rather than make false claims.  
* If you are unable to answer, describe how you would find the answer.  
* Structure your response. Use a simple framework like STAR (Situation → Task → Action → Result) or CAR (Context → Action → Result).  
* Keep answers concise. Avoid rambling at all costs.
