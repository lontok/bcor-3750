- Run 1,000-10,000 simulations
- Analyze probability distributions of outcomes
- Determine risk and confidence intervals
- **Connection to [Decision Area]**: [What uncertainty this models]

## Business Questions to Answer

1. **Descriptive**: [Question related to descriptive analytics and decision area]
2. **Diagnostic**: [Question related to diagnostic analytics and decision area]
3. **Predictive**: [Question related to predictive analytics and decision area]
4. **Prescriptive**: [Question related to prescriptive analytics and decision area]

## Interview Preparation
