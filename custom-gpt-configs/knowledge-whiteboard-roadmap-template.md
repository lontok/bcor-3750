# Whiteboard Roadmap Template

## Purpose
Students must draw this visual roadmap on the whiteboard during their Midterm Interview to guide their project presentation. This demonstrates their understanding of the project flow from Foundation → Descriptive → Diagnostic Analytics.

## Template Structure

```
[Job Title] → [Decision Area] → [Stakeholder] → [Problem Statement]
                                                         ↓
                                                [Solution Overview]
                                                         ↓
                                        [Dataset] → [Data Quality] → [Primary Metric]
                                                         ↓
                        ┌────────────────────────────────┴─────────────────────────────────┐
                        ↓                                                                   ↓
              [DESCRIPTIVE ANALYTICS]                                         [DIAGNOSTIC ANALYTICS]
                        ↓                                                                   ↓
        Statistics: Central Tendency + Variability                          PivotTable 1: Root Cause
                        ↓                                                                   ↓
        Strategic Dashboard (1 of 3 charts)                                 PivotTable 2: Root Cause
                                                                                            ↓
                                                                        Operational Dashboard (1 of 3 charts)
```

## Drawing Instructions

**Direction:** Draw from left to right and top to bottom as you speak

**Flow:**
1. Start with horizontal flow: Job → Decision Area → Stakeholder → Problem
2. Vertical arrow down to Solution Overview
3. Another vertical arrow to Data section (Dataset → Data Quality → Primary Metric)
4. Split into two branches: Descriptive (left) and Diagnostic (right)
5. Continue downward for each analytics type's components

**Key Points:**
- Each box = one slide (or group of related slides)
- Use arrows to show logical flow
- Keep it simple - this is your navigation tool, not your content
- Should be able to draw in under 30 seconds with practice

## Component Details

### Foundation Row
**[Job Title] → [Decision Area] → [Stakeholder] → [Problem Statement]**

Example:
```
Supply Chain Analyst → Supply Chain Mgmt → Fulfillment Ops Manager → "Delivery times 73% over target"
```

### Solution Overview
**[Solution Overview]**

Example:
```
Use descriptive & diagnostic analytics to identify root causes and reduce delivery time
```

### Data Foundation
**[Dataset] → [Data Quality] → [Primary Metric]**

Example:
```
6 months fulfillment data → Fixed 3 issues → Delivery Time (days)
```

### Analytics Branches

**Left Branch - DESCRIPTIVE ANALYTICS:**
```
DESCRIPTIVE ANALYTICS
         ↓
Central Tendency + Variability
         ↓
Strategic Dashboard (Scorecard/Trend/Breakdown - choose 1)
```

**Right Branch - DIAGNOSTIC ANALYTICS:**
```
DIAGNOSTIC ANALYTICS
         ↓
PivotTable 1: Root Cause (e.g., by Region)
         ↓
PivotTable 2: Root Cause (e.g., by Shift)
         ↓
Operational Dashboard (Scorecard/Trend/Root Cause - choose 1)
```

## Interview Coach Validation

When student uploads a photo of their whiteboard roadmap, validate:

**Structure Check:**
- [ ] Horizontal Foundation row (Job → Decision Area → Stakeholder → Problem)
- [ ] Vertical flow to Solution Overview
- [ ] Data Foundation row (Dataset → Data Quality → Primary Metric)
- [ ] Clear split into Descriptive (left) and Diagnostic (right) branches
- [ ] All required components present in each branch

**Content Check:**
- [ ] Job title matches their project
- [ ] Decision Area is one of the 10 OM decision areas
- [ ] Stakeholder is specific (name/title if possible)
- [ ] Problem statement follows format: "[Stakeholder] has [problem] which causes [impact]"
- [ ] Dataset described briefly (source, timeframe, size)
- [ ] Data Quality references specific issues fixed
- [ ] Primary Metric clearly stated (metric name + unit)
- [ ] Descriptive branch shows both Central Tendency AND Variability
- [ ] Diagnostic branch shows 2 PivotTables with different dimensions

**Visual Check:**
- [ ] Arrows show clear flow direction
- [ ] Boxes are distinct and labeled
- [ ] Legible handwriting
- [ ] Fits on one whiteboard/page
- [ ] Can be understood at a glance

## Feedback Examples

### ✅ STRONG Whiteboard:
"Excellent roadmap! Your structure is clear with proper Foundation → Solution → Data → Analytics flow. I can see:
- Job (Supply Chain Analyst) → Decision Area (Supply Chain Mgmt) → Stakeholder (Fulfillment Ops Manager, Jane Smith) → Problem ('Delivery times 7.3 days vs 3-day target')
- Solution clearly stated
- Data foundation complete (6mo data, fixed 3 issues, Delivery Time metric)
- Descriptive branch shows Central Tendency + Variability + Strategic Dashboard (Trend chart)
- Diagnostic branch shows PivotTable by Region + PivotTable by Carrier + Operational Dashboard

This demonstrates you understand the full project flow. You can use this to navigate during your actual interview."

### ⚠️ NEEDS IMPROVEMENT Whiteboard:
"Your roadmap has the basic structure but needs refinement:

**Missing/Unclear Elements:**
- Problem Statement is too vague: 'delivery issues' → Be specific: '[Stakeholder] has [exact problem] which causes [business impact]'
- Data Quality box just says 'cleaned data' → State what you fixed: '3 issues: missing values, duplicates, date formats'
- Descriptive branch missing Variability component → Must show Central Tendency AND Variability

**Structure Issues:**
- The split from Data to Descriptive/Diagnostic isn't clear → Draw a clearer branching arrow showing these run in parallel
- Operational Dashboard is missing from Diagnostic branch

**Recommendations:**
1. Revise Problem Statement to match required format
2. Add specific Data Quality details
3. Add Variability to Descriptive branch
4. Add Operational Dashboard to Diagnostic branch
5. Clarify the branching visual from Data → Descriptive/Diagnostic

Redraw with these corrections and upload again for feedback."

### ❌ INSUFFICIENT Whiteboard:
"Your roadmap is incomplete and missing critical components:

**Major Gaps:**
- No Decision Area shown (which of the 10 OM decision areas?)
- No Stakeholder identification (who are you analyzing for?)
- Problem Statement missing entirely
- Data Quality box absent (what issues did you fix?)
- Primary Metric not specified (what are you measuring?)
- Descriptive Analytics shows only Central Tendency (missing Variability)
- Diagnostic Analytics shows only 1 PivotTable (need 2)
- No dashboard components shown

**What You Need:**
- Complete Foundation row: Job → Decision Area → Stakeholder → Problem
- Add Solution Overview
- Add Data Foundation row: Dataset → Data Quality → Primary Metric
- Descriptive branch: Central Tendency + Variability + Strategic Dashboard
- Diagnostic branch: PivotTable 1 + PivotTable 2 + Operational Dashboard

**Action:** Review the Whiteboard Roadmap Template (Study Guide lines 168-196) and redraw with ALL required components. This is your navigation tool for the interview - you need to be able to draw this from memory in under 30 seconds."

## Practice Tips for Students

**Memorization:**
1. Practice drawing the structure 5-10 times from memory
2. Time yourself - can you complete it in 30 seconds?
3. Practice while talking through each component
4. Ensure you can draw while maintaining eye contact

**Content Preparation:**
- Know your specific content for each box (don't just draw empty boxes)
- Be ready to point to sections while discussing them
- Use the roadmap to navigate when answering questions

**Common Mistakes:**
- Drawing too small (make it visible from 6 feet away)
- Forgetting to label arrows
- Missing the Data Quality or Primary Metric boxes
- Not showing the split between Descriptive and Diagnostic clearly
- Incomplete Analytics branches (missing required components)

## Integration with Interview Flow

**When to Draw:**
After "Tell me about yourself" and before diving into Foundation details:

**Professor:** "Tell me about your project."

**Student:** "Let me start by drawing the project roadmap on the whiteboard to show you the overall flow."

[Draws roadmap while narrating]

"My project analyzes [Dataset] for [Stakeholder] at [Company] who faces [Problem]. I used Descriptive Analytics to understand what happened through central tendency, variability, and strategic dashboards. Then I used Diagnostic Analytics with pivot tables and operational dashboards to identify why it happened and root causes..."

[Uses roadmap as navigation tool throughout interview, pointing to sections as you discuss them]
