## 6. Test Critical Behaviors

- GPT should ask ONE question, wait for response, then ask next question
- ‚ùå Should NOT ask multiple questions in one message

### Test 2: Socratic Questioning ‚úÖ
- When asked a question, respond "I don't know"
- GPT should ask guiding questions (NOT give direct answer)
- Should see 4 levels: Clarification ‚Üí Connecting ‚Üí Probing ‚Üí Leading

### Test 3: IRPM Validation ‚úÖ
- Describe a central tendency finding (just state the number)
- GPT should prompt for all 4 IRPM elements:
  - I - Insight (what it means)
  - R - Recommendation (what to do)
  - P - Prediction (expected outcome)
  - M - Method (how you calculated)

### Test 4: Feedback Quality ‚úÖ
- Complete a practice session
- Check debrief includes:
  - ‚úÖ 4 rubric dimensions (Depth 40%, Business 30%, Communication 20%, Synthesis 10%)
  - ‚úÖ 2-3 specific weaknesses with examples
  - ‚úÖ Study guide references (line numbers)
  - ‚úÖ Rubric quote for performance level

### Test 5: Whiteboard Simulation ‚úÖ

## 7. Share with Students

**Share Link Format:**
```
https://chatgpt.com/g/g-XXXXXX-bcor-3750-midterm-interview-coach
```

**Recommended Student Instructions:**
> "Practice your Midterm Interview with the AI coach. Upload your Milestone 1 slides for personalized feedback, or practice without slides for generic questions. The coach will ask ONE question at a time, guide you with Socratic questioning if you struggle, and provide honest feedback based on the interview rubric."

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: GPT asks multiple questions
**Fix:** In Instructions, emphasize "Never ask multiple questions in a single message"

### Issue: GPT gives direct answers
**Fix:** Test Socratic questioning section - should have 4-level strategy

### Issue: GPT doesn't validate IRPM
**Fix:** Check Knowledge files uploaded correctly - especially `knowledge-irpm-framework-reference.md`

### Issue: Feedback is generic
**Fix:** Review "FEEDBACK STRUCTURE" section in Instructions - should reference specific examples from session

### Issue: Study guide not referenced
**Fix:** Verify all 4 Knowledge files uploaded and accessible
