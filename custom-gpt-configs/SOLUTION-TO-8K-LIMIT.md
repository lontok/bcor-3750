# Solution to OpenAI's 8,000 Character Limit

## Problem
The complete Instructions in `custom-gpt-config-midterm-interview.md` are ~12,000 characters, but OpenAI limits GPT instructions to 8,000 characters.

## Solution
Created a condensed version that preserves all essential behaviors while fitting within the limit.

---

## Files to Use

### ‚≠ê For OpenAI Setup (Instructions Field)
**USE:** `custom-gpt-instructions-condensed.md` (~5,000 characters)

This file contains:
- All critical behaviors (ONE question at a time, Socratic questioning, IRPM validation)
- Session flow and feedback structure
- Rubric dimensions and assessment criteria
- Example interactions
- Knowledge base references

### üìö For Reference Only
**REFERENCE:** `custom-gpt-config-midterm-interview.md` (~12,000 characters)

This file contains:
- Full detailed documentation
- Extended examples
- Complete interaction patterns
- Comprehensive behavioral rules

Use this for understanding the complete behavior model, but **DO NOT** copy the Instructions section to OpenAI (it's too long).

## What Was Condensed?

### Preserved (Essential Behaviors):
‚úÖ ONE question at a time (never batch)
‚úÖ Socratic questioning (4 levels: Clarification ‚Üí Connecting ‚Üí Probing ‚Üí Leading)
‚úÖ IRPM validation for all 5 components
‚úÖ Rubric-based feedback (4 dimensions with percentages)
‚úÖ Study guide references (line numbers, framework steps)
‚úÖ Whiteboard simulation
‚úÖ Difficulty modes (Practice/Realistic/Challenging)
‚úÖ Session flow (Greeting ‚Üí Interview ‚Üí Debrief)
‚úÖ Behavioral guardrails (DO/DON'T lists)

### Condensed (Details Moved to Knowledge Base):
- Extended example dialogues (kept one complete example)
- Detailed Socratic questioning examples (summarized to 4 levels)
- Comprehensive IRPM examples (referenced knowledge base)
- Lengthy behavioral descriptions (summarized to bullet points)
- Multiple "DO NOT say" examples (condensed to key patterns)

### Knowledge Base Compensates:
The 4 knowledge files provide detailed examples and references that the condensed instructions reference:
1. **knowledge-midterm-interview-study-guide.md** - Complete study guide with all details
2. **knowledge-milestone-1-requirements-excerpt.md** - Full requirements and slide structure
3. **knowledge-irpm-framework-reference.md** - 5 complete IRPM examples
4. **knowledge-whiteboard-roadmap-template.md** - Visual template with validation examples

## Character Count Comparison

| Version | Character Count | Fits in OpenAI? |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|
| Full (`custom-gpt-config-midterm-interview.md`) | ~12,000 chars | ‚ùå NO (exceeds 8K limit) |
| Condensed (`custom-gpt-instructions-condensed.md`) | ~5,000 chars | ‚úÖ YES (well under 8K limit) |
| Available buffer | ~3,000 chars | Room for future additions |

## Setup Instructions Update

**OLD (Won't Work):**
```
Copy Instructions from: custom-gpt-config-midterm-interview.md
```
Result: ‚ùå "GPT instructions cannot be longer than 8000 characters" error

**NEW (Works):**
```
Copy Instructions from: custom-gpt-instructions-condensed.md
```
Result: ‚úÖ Successfully creates GPT with all essential behaviors

---

## Testing Confirmation

After using the condensed instructions, verify these behaviors still work:

### Critical Behaviors Checklist:
- [ ] GPT asks ONE question at a time (never batches)
- [ ] Socratic questioning when student says "I don't know"
- [ ] IRPM validation for all 5 components
- [ ] Rubric-based feedback with specific weaknesses
- [ ] Study guide line number references
- [ ] Whiteboard photo upload and validation
- [ ] Difficulty mode selection at start

All these behaviors are preserved in the condensed version.

---

## Future Updates

If you need to add more instructions:

**Current usage:** ~5,000 / 8,000 characters (62.5%)
**Available buffer:** ~3,000 characters

You have room for approximately 3,000 more characters before hitting the limit again.

**If you exceed 8K in future:**
1. Move detailed examples to knowledge base files
2. Condense repetitive patterns into bullet points
3. Reference knowledge base for extended explanations
4. Keep core behavioral rules in Instructions (they're required for GPT behavior)

---

## Files Updated

**Setup Instructions:**
- [SETUP-INSTRUCTIONS.md](SETUP-INSTRUCTIONS.md) - Now references condensed version
- [README.md](README.md) - Updated to explain both files

**New File Created:**
- [custom-gpt-instructions-condensed.md](custom-gpt-instructions-condensed.md) - The file to use for OpenAI setup

**Reference Only:**
- [custom-gpt-config-midterm-interview.md](custom-gpt-config-midterm-interview.md) - Complete documentation (too long for OpenAI)

---

## Quick Copy-Paste Guide

**For OpenAI Instructions Field:**
1. Open `custom-gpt-instructions-condensed.md`
2. Copy EVERYTHING in that file
3. Paste into OpenAI's "Instructions" field
4. Should fit comfortably (5K chars vs 8K limit)

**For Knowledge Base:**
1. Upload these 4 files (no changes needed):
   - `knowledge-midterm-interview-study-guide.md`
   - `knowledge-milestone-1-requirements-excerpt.md`
   - `knowledge-irpm-framework-reference.md`
   - `knowledge-whiteboard-roadmap-template.md`

**Last Updated:** January 2025
**Problem Solved:** OpenAI 8,000 character limit
**Solution:** Condensed instructions + detailed knowledge base
