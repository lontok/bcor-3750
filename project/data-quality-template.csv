Project: [Your Name - Project Title]
Date: [Assessment Date]
Dataset: [Dataset Name/Description]

ASSESSMENT OVERVIEW
Original Dataset Records: [X]
Cleaned Dataset Records: [X]
Records Removed: [X] ([X]%)
Records Updated: [X] ([X]%)
Issues Identified: [X]
Issues Fixed: [X]
Issues Not Fixed: [X]

===========================================
ISSUE #1: [TYPE OF ISSUE - e.g., Missing Values]
===========================================

1. IDENTIFY:
[Description of the issue, which fields affected, how many records]
Example: "Missing values found in 'Customer_Region' field affecting 45 records (3.2% of dataset)"

2. ASSESS:
[Business impact - how does this affect analysis or decisions?]
Example: "Missing region data prevents geographic analysis and regional performance comparisons"

3. ANALYZE:
[Plausible root cause - suggest a reasonable explanation for why this issue might have occurred]
Example: "Likely caused by optional field in data entry form or system migration that didn't preserve all region codes"

4. DECIDE:
[Your decision - Remove / Update / Do Nothing]
Example: "UPDATE - Will impute missing values using mode of region by customer segment"

5. FIX:
[What you did to fix it, or why you chose not to fix]
Example: "Created lookup table mapping customer segments to most common regions, applied to 45 missing records"

===========================================
ISSUE #2: [TYPE OF ISSUE - e.g., Duplicate Records]
